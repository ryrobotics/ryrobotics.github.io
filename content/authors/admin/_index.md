I am a Lecturer in the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), where I work with our teaching team to design and coordinate active learning initiatives, including the flagship Engineering Challenges course. My focus is on advancing immersive, hands-on engineering education that brings together autonomous systems, intelligent robotics, and AI applications, empowering students to tackle real-world problems from concept to prototype.
