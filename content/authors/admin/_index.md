I am a PhD candidate in the Mechanical and Automation Engineering department at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), specifically in the areas of collision-resilient UAV, safety-aware motion planning, and autonomous drone inspection. I am passionate about designing and implementing algorithms and hardware systems that enhance the intelligence and resilience of UAVs in real-world applications.
