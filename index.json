Drone‚Äôs components 4K HD camera: This camera offers impressive capabilities including 20MP photo capture, 4K@30FPS video recording, and Electronic Image Stabilization.\nBrushless DC Motor \u0026amp; Propeller: Motors are responsible for spinning the propellers and generating thrust (up to a maximum of 6.4kg) to lift the drone off the ground.\nOnboard Computer Onboard computer provides powerful computing capabilities for autonomous inspection algorithms and data collection.\nCarbon Fiber Composite Cage The lightweight but reliable cage holds all the components together and protects the internal components from damage.\n3D LiDAR This compact yet powerful 3D LiDAR provides precise 360-degree data collection and perception, offering centimeter-level accuracy.\nFlight Controller The flight controller is like the brain of the drone. It contains sensors (such as gyroscopes and accelerometers) and processes data to stabilize and control the drone‚Äôs movements.\nElectronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) ESCs control the speed and direction of each motor. They receive commands from the flight controller and adjust the power sent to the motors accordingly.\nBattery The battery supplies power to the drone. It is a rechargeable lithium polymer (LiPo) battery with a capacity of 6000 mAh.\n2. Advantages of our drone Speed The drone is designed for quick deployment and ease of use. In our swimming pool trial, we completed the ceiling inspection, including pre-flight preparations and actual flights (about 20 mins), in just 2 hours.\nSafety To ensure safety, the drone is equipped with a customized cage that fully covers its body, providing ample protection for both the drone and the surrounding facilities. Additionally, autonomous flight capabilities and intelligent collision avoidance algorithms contribute to safe and controlled operations.\nAccuracy With its powerful 3D LiDAR (centimeter-level accuracy) and advanced localization algorithm, the drone can provide high-accuracy point cloud data collection. This precision allows operators to precisely identify and locate defects in the following inspections.\nFlexibility The drone‚Äôs design is tailored for inspections, making it adaptable to various application scenarios. For instance, an up-looking camera is included specifically for ceiling inspections, enhancing its performance in our swimming pool trial.\n","date":1684195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684195200,"objectID":"93267b593764c9ceea54ad45d029d5f1","permalink":"https://ryrobotics.github.io/project/swimming-pool/","publishdate":"2023-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/swimming-pool/","section":"project","summary":"This project presents a fully autonomous drone-based inspection for the ceiling of a standard swimming pool.","tags":["Inspection"],"title":"Autonomous Drone Inspection for Swimming Pool Ceiling","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1682812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682812800,"objectID":"3db11af8a087f2e1a5fb4529232ad0ef","permalink":"https://ryrobotics.github.io/project/drone-inspection/","publishdate":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/drone-inspection/","section":"project","summary":"This project presents an autonomous indoor drone inspection system with a novel GPU-accelerated mapping algorithm and an AI-based Building Information Modeling method.","tags":["Inspection"],"title":"Autonomous Indoor Drone Inspection and Modeling System","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chuanxiang Gao","Xinyi Wang","Ruoyu Wang","Zuoquan Zhao","Yu Zhai","Xi Chen","Ben M Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695477945,"objectID":"f352d06627779dc80c5c386cd02a4371","permalink":"https://ryrobotics.github.io/publication/gao-2023-uav/","publishdate":"2023-09-23T14:05:24.154985Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gao-2023-uav/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A UAV-based explore-then-exploit system for autonomous indoor facility inspection and scene reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jihan Zhang","Ruoyu Wang","Guidong Yang","Kangcheng Liu","Chuanxiang Gao","Yu Zhai","Xi Chen","Ben M Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1655769600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695477945,"objectID":"043f3f903a3b1059ebaf9c8199de8e94","permalink":"https://ryrobotics.github.io/publication/zhang-2022-sim/","publishdate":"2023-09-23T14:05:45.789036Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2022-sim/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sim-in-real: Digital twin based uav inspection process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruoyu Wang","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
